      "prompt": "**Scene Description:**  \n\nA dimly lit studio with warm, golden backlighting casting soft shadows—moody yet intimate. The camera slowly pushes in toward **AI Lao Gao**, seated casually in a leather armchair, his face half-illuminated by the glow of a vintage desk lamp. Outside the window, rain streaks faintly against the glass, adding texture to the atmosphere.  \n\nHis expression shifts subtly—calm yet purposeful—as he leans slightly forward, gripping the arms of the chair. The camera lingers on his eyes, reflecting a mix of intrigue and solemnity. A deep hum of distant thunder underscores his opening words, amplifying the mystery.  \n\n**Cut to:**  \nA brief flash of a **satellite map overlay**—blinking coordinates dissolving into static—hinting at the enigma of MH370 before fading back to his steady gaze.  \n\n*(Tone: Suspenseful, immersive, documentary-style storytelling.)*",

Through the small oval windows, the dark expanse of the sky stretches endlessly, occasionally pierced by distant stars.  \n\n**Camera:** A slow tracking shot down the aisle, slightly low-angle, capturing weary passengers slumped in their seats—some sleeping under thin airline blankets, others staring blankly at seatback screens flickering with muted movies.  \n\n**Atmosphere:** Subdued, almost surreal—the hum of engines blends with muffled coughs and rustling. A flight attendant moves quietly, her silhouette casting long shadows as she checks seatbelts. Outside, the wingtip light pulses steadily, cutting through the thick, restless clouds below.  \n\n**Mood:** Isolation meets routine—the eerie quiet of a red-eye flight where time feels suspended.",
