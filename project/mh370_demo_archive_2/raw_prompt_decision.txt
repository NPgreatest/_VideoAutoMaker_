      "prompt": "**Scene Description:**  \n\n*Opening Shot:*  \nA dimly lit study, warm amber light pools over a mahogany desk cluttered with old books, maps, and scattered notes. The glow of a vintage desk lamp casts long shadows across weathered documents marked with red annotations—flight paths, coordinates, and cryptic symbols. The air feels thick with mystery, faint dust motes drifting lazily in the lamplight.  \n\n*Camera Movement:*  \nA slow push-in reveals **Lao Gao**, seated in a high-backed leather chair, his face half-lit by the flickering glow of a nearby monitor displaying satellite imagery of the Indian Ocean. His expression is grave but composed, fingertips steepled in contemplation. The camera lingers on his hands—slightly worn, hinting at long nights spent researching.  \n\n*Ambiance & Tone:*  \nThe room hums with quiet tension—low, distant thunder rumbles outside, suggesting an approaching storm. The faint ticking of an antique clock underscores the unresolved nature of the topic. Shadows stretch unnaturally across a large corkboard behind him, pinned with newspaper clippings and blurred photographs of MH370. A single red thread connects them like a detective’s conspiracy wall.  \n\n*Lighting:*  \nHigh contrast—cool blue moonlight seeps through partially drawn curtains, clashing with the warm interior light. The interplay creates an eerie duality, mirroring the mystery’s blend of fact and speculation.  \n\n*Sound Design:*  \nA",

Neon signage casts a sickly glow over empty check-in counters, their screens frozen on flight details—MH370 among them. A lone janitor pushes a mop in slow, rhythmic arcs, the squeak of rubber echoing through the cavernous space. Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, runway lights stretch into the darkness like fading stars, illuminating the silhouette of Malaysia Airlines' Boeing 777 being prepped for boarding.  \n\n**Lighting:**  \nCold, clinical fluorescence dominates the interior—harsh overhead panels bleach color from the scene. Outside, the tarmac is bathed in the orange sodium haze of industrial lamps, punctuated by the intermittent flash of taxiway beacons. Shadows stretch long and distorted as ground crew move under the aircraft’s belly, their handheld torches cutting brief, desperate arcs through the humid night.  \n\n**Camera Movement:**  \nA slow, restless tracking shot glides past rows of vacant gate seats, catching glimpses of crumpled boarding passes and abandoned coffee cups. The lens lingers on a departure board—the digits of MH370’s scheduled takeoff time (00:41) ticking silently into irrelevance. As the camera drifts toward the jet bridge, the glass walls reflect distorted images of passengers lining up: blurred",

Rows of passengers slump in their seats—some asleep with neck pillows askew, others blearily scrolling through phones or watching in-flight entertainment with glazed eyes. The hum of the engines is a constant, lulling drone.  \n\n**Camera Movement:**  \nA slow, steady tracking shot glides down the aisle, catching glimpses of weary travelers—a business traveler typing half-heartedly on a laptop, a parent rocking a restless child, a lone passenger staring blankly out the window at the void beyond. The camera lingers briefly on an empty drink cup wobbling slightly in its seatback holder.  \n\n**Lighting:**  \nCold, muted blue LED reading lights cast isolated pools of illumination amid the darkness. The glow of seatback screens flickers across tired faces, deepening the shadows under their eyes. Outside the windows, only the faintest hint of moonlight reflects off the wing’s edge.  \n\n**Tone:**  \nA quiet, almost meditative monotony—routine exhaustion suspended between departure and arrival. There’s a subtle tension beneath the calm, the kind that comes with forced stillness, the body resisting sleep despite the late hour. The scene feels both intimate and detached, as if observing ghosts in transit.  \n\n**Sound Design:**  \nThe distant hiss of air",
